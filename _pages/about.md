I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia supervised by Christos Thrampoulidis in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and by Mark Schmidt in the
Department of Computer Science. I received my BS from California Polytechnic State University in 2017 with a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics. I received my MS from the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2020 and my
PhD in 2022, advised by Emiliano Dallâ€™Anese and Stephen Becker. I enjoy walking in the woods, composing poems, and dancing with friends.
